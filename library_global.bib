              (strain-gradient-induced electrical polarization) suggests that
              flexoelectricity could have physiological effects in bones, and
              specifically near bone fractures, where flexoelectricity is
              theoretically highest. Here, we report a cytological study of the
              interaction between crack stress and bone cells. We have cultured
              MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells in biomimetic microcracked
              hydroxyapatite substrates, differentiated into osteocytes and
              applied a strain gradient to the samples. The results show a
              strong apoptotic cellular response, whereby mechanical
              stimulation causes those cells near the crack to die, as
              indicated by live-dead and caspase staining. In addition,
              analysis two weeks post-stimulation shows increased cell
              attachment and mineralization around microcracks and a higher
              expression of osteocalcin -an osteogenic protein known to be
              promoted by physical exercise. The results are consistent with
              flexoelectricity playing at least two different roles in bone
              remodelling: apoptotic trigger of the repair protocol, and
              electro-stimulant of the bone-building activity of osteoblasts.",

              mature, dynamic bone structure via a balance between bone
              formation by osteoblasts and resorption by osteoclasts. These
              opposite processes allow the accommodation of bones to dynamic
              mechanical forces, altering bone mass in response to changing
              conditions. Mechanical forces are indispensable for bone
              homeostasis; skeletal formation, resorption, and adaptation are
              dependent on mechanical signals, and loss of mechanical

              pulp-dentin complex and restore its functions compromised by pulp
              injury and/or inflammation. Because of unique anatomic
              limitations of the tooth structure, engineering a suitable
              microenvironment that facilitates angio/vasculogenesis and
              innervation is a challenging task. Cell-based tissue engineering
              approaches have shown great potential in achieving this goal.
              Biomedical approaches in creating a regenerative microenvironment
              are mainly represented by either scaffold-based or scaffold-free
              strategies. The scaffold-based strategy mainly relies on the use
              of biomaterials to create a structural base that supports cells
              throughout the process of tissue formation. The scaffold could be
              a classic 3-dimensional construct with interconnected pores, a
              hydrogel with cells embedded in it, or a combination of these 2.
              The scaffold-free approach has been considered a bottom-up
              strategy that uses cell sheets, spheroids, or tissue strands as
              building blocks. The outcome of this strategy relies on the
              capacity of these building blocks to secrete a favorable
              extracellular matrix and to fuse into larger tissue constructs.
              Both the scaffold-free and scaffold-based systems are required as
              complementary, rather than competing, approaches for pulp
              regeneration. A combined synergetic strategy, through which
              multicellular building blocks could be integrated with robust
              3-dimensional scaffolds, might represent an optimal solution to

              orthotopic bone defects. The limited inductive capacity
              orthotopically of TGF-beta isoforms is associated with expression

              into osteocytes embedded in mineralized bone matrix. Despite the
              fact that osteocytes are the most abundant cellular component of
              bone, little is known about the process of
              osteoblast-to-osteocyte transformation. What is known is that
              osteoblasts undergo a number of changes during this
              transformation, yet retain their connections to preosteoblasts
              and osteocytes. This review explores the osteoblast-to-osteocyte

              could become entrapped in the bone matrix (in mammals) and

              Those osteoblasts on the bone surface that are destined for
              burial and destined to become osteocytes slow down matrix
              production compared to neighbouring osteoblasts, which continue
              to produce bone matrix. That is, cells that continue to produce
              matrix actively bury cells producing less or no new bone matrix

              and management of fragility fractures in the largest five
              countries of the European Union plus Sweden (EU6). In 2017, new
              fragility fractures in the EU6 are estimated at 2.7 million with
              an associated annual cost of 37.5 billion euros and a loss of 1.0
              million quality-adjusted life years. INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis
              is characterized by reduced bone mass and strength, which
              increases the risk of fragility fractures, which in turn,
              represent the main consequence of the disease. This report
              provides an overview and a comparison of the burden and
              management of fragility fractures in the largest five EU
              countries and Sweden (designated the EU6). METHODS: A series of
              metrics describing the burden and management of fragility
              fractures were defined by a scientific steering committee. A
              working group performed the data collection and analysis. Data
              were collected from current literature, available retrospective
              data and public sources. Different methods were applied (e.g.
              standard statistics and health economic modelling), where
              appropriate, to perform the analysis for each metric. RESULTS:
              Total fragility fractures in the EU6 are estimated to increase
              from 2.7 million in 2017 to 3.3 million in 2030; a 23\% increase.
              The resulting annual fracture-related costs (37.5 billion euros in
              2017) are expected to increase by 27\%. An estimated 1.0 million
              quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were lost in 2017 due to
              fragility fractures. The current disability-adjusted life years
              (DALYs) per 1000 individuals age 50 years or more were estimated
              at 21 years, which is higher than the estimates for stroke or
              chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The treatment gap
              (percentage of eligible individuals not receiving treatment with
              osteoporosis drugs) in the EU6 is estimated to be 73\% for women
              and 63\% for men; an increase of 17\% since 2010. If all patients
              who fracture in the EU6 were enrolled into fracture liaison
              services, at least 19,000 fractures every year might be avoided.
              CONCLUSIONS: Fracture-related burden is expected to increase over
              the coming decades. Given the substantial treatment gap and
              proven cost-effectiveness of fracture prevention schemes such as
              fracture liaison services, urgent action is needed to ensure that
              all individuals at high risk of fragility fracture are
              appropriately assessed and treated.",

              stability of bone as an organ. In many cases, the correction of
              bone defects requires extensive surgical intervention involving
              the use of bone-grafting techniques and other procedures in which
              healing is slow, there is a high risk of infection and
              considerable pain is provoked - with no guarantee of complete
              correction of the defect. Therefore, the search for surgical
              alternatives continues to present a major challenge in
              orthopaedic traumatology. The reamer-irrigator-aspirator (RIA)
              system, which was devised to avoid the problems that can arise
              with autograft harvesting from the iliac crest, consists of
              collecting the product of the femoral canal after reaming. The
              RIA technique improves osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal
              stem cells, compared to bone marrow aspiration or cancellous bone
              harvesting from the iliac crest using a spoon. Another approach,
              the Masquelet technique, consists of reconstructing a long bone
              defect by means of an induced membrane grown onto an acrylic
              cement rod inserted to fill the defect; in a second surgical
              step, once the membrane is constituted, the cement rod is removed
              and cancellous autograft is used to fill the defect. Both in RIA
              and in the Masquelet technique, osteosynthesis is usually needed.
              Bone transportation by compression-distraction lengthening
              principles is commonly implemented for the treatment of large
              bone loss. However, complications are frequently encountered with
              these techniques. Among new techniques that have been proposed to
              address the problem of large bone loss, the application of stem
              cells in conjunction with tissue engineering techniques is very
              promising, as is the creation of personalised medicine (or
              precision medicine), in which molecular profiling technologies
              are used to tailor the therapeutic strategy, to ensure the right
              method is applied for the right person at the right time, after
              determining the predisposition to disease among the general
              population. All of the above techniques for addressing bone

  abstract = "A fundamental variable in culture medium is its pH, which must be
              controlled by an appropriately formulated buffering regime, since
              biological processes are exquisitely sensitive to acid-base
              chemistry. Although awareness of the importance of pH is fostered
              early in the training of researchers, there are no consensus
              guidelines for best practice in managing pH in cell cultures, and
              reporting standards relating to pH are typically inadequate.
              Furthermore, many laboratories adopt bespoke approaches to
              controlling pH, some of which inadvertently produce artefacts
              that increase noise, compromise reproducibility or lead to the
              misinterpretation of data. Here, we use real-time measurements of
              medium pH and intracellular pH under live-cell culture conditions
              to describe the effects of various buffering regimes, including
              physiological CO2/HCO3 - and non-volatile buffers (e.g. HEPES).
              We highlight those cases that result in poor control,
              non-intuitive outcomes and erroneous inferences. To improve data
              reproducibility, we propose guidelines for controlling pH in

              typically used to describe the atmospheric conditions of a
              standard incubator, not the true microenvironment to which the
              cells are exposed. This error may lead to the situation where

              actually be experiencing a wide range of conditions ranging from
              hyperoxia to near-anoxic conditions at the cellular level. This

              nutrient supply into cells within a scaffold is essential to
              increase cell viability and the proliferation rate. Generally,
              oxygen and nutrients reach the cells through the media by
              diffusion in vitro or in vivo, assuming there is no convection
              flow through a scaffold with small-sized pores. The scaffold
              diffusion rate depends mainly on the scaffold pore architecture.
              Thus, understanding the effect of scaffold pore architecture on

              This method can be applied to evaluate and analyze the effective
              diffusivity of a freeform fabricated 3D scaffold. The diffusion
              application module of commercial FEA software was used to

              be calculated from the oxygen concentration data, which revealed
              that the scaffold pore architecture influences its effective
              diffusivity. The proposed method has been verified experimentally

              are produced throughout the scaffold and from one scaffold to
              another needs to be quantified. Small variations at the pore
              level can affect the local mechanical stimuli sensed by the cells
              thereby affecting the final tissue properties. Most studies
              assume rapid prototyping scaffolds as regular structures without

              this study, a computational method using a micro-computed
              tomography-based scaffold geometry was developed to characterize
              the mechanical stimuli within a real scaffold at the pore level.
              Five samples from a commercial polycaprolactone scaffold were

              bone replacement and regeneration. Yet most such scaffolds
              produced today are characterized by very basic geometry, and
              their microstructure differs greatly from that of the actual
              tissue they are intended to replace. In this paper, we propose a
              novel approach for generating micro-scale scaffolds based on
              processing actual micro-CT images and then reconstructing a
              highly accurate geometrical model. This model is manufactured by
              means of a state-of-the-art 3D additive manufacturing process
              from biocompatible materials. At the micro-scale level, these
              scaffolds are very similar to the original tissue, thus
              interfacing better with the surrounding tissue and facilitating
              more efficient rehabilitation for the patient. Moreover, the
              approach facilitates the design and manufacture of
              patient-specific scaffolds which can copy patients' exact
              structural and mechanical characteristics, taking into account
              their physical condition and medical history. By means of
              multi-resolution volumetric modeling methods, scaffold porosity
              can also be adapted according to specific mechanical
              requirements. The process of designing and manufacturing
              micro-scale scaffolds involves five major stages: (a) building a
              volumetric multi-resolution model from micro-CT images; (b)
              generation of surface geometric model in STL format; (c) additive
              manufacturing of the scaffold; (d) scaffold shape verification
              relative to the geometric design; and (e) verification of
              mechanical properties through finite element analysis. In this
              research, all the proposed stages of the approach were tested.
              The input included micro-CT scans of porous ceramic structure,
              which is quite similar to commercial porous scaffolds. The

               the fracture repair process in humans was first reported by
               Xavier \& Duarte in 1983 [1]. This success led to clinical
               trials and the 1994 approval of LIPUS in the United States for
               the accelerated healing of certain fresh fractures. LIPUS was
               approved in the US for the treatment of established non-unions
               in 2000, and is also approved around the world. In this article,
               we present relevant literature on the effect of LIPUS on bone
               healing in patients with acute fractures and non-unions and
               provide a molecular explanation for the effects of LIPUS on bone
               healing. Data on LIPUS accelerated fracture repair is
               controversial with many controlled studies showing a positive
               effect. However, the largest trial in acute tibial fractures
               stabilized with an intramedullary nail failed to show
               significant differences in accelerated healing and in functional
               outcomes. Uncontrolled data from prospective case series suggest
               a positive effect of LIPUS in non united fractures with healing
               rates of around 85\%. Evaluation of results from studies, both
               positive and negative, has enabled an understanding that the
               patient population with potentially the greatest benefit from
               receiving LIPUS are those at-risk for fracture healing, e.g.
               diabetic \& elderly patients. The elucidation of a pathway to
               activate the Rac-1 pathway by LIPUS might explain this
               beneficial effect. Overall, there is a strong need for further
               clinical trials, particularly for acute fractures at risk of

              generation of cyclic hydrostatic forces as bone compression is
              transduced to fluid pressure in the canalicular network and the
              joint synovium. It has therefore been suggested that hydrostatic
              pressure is an important stimulus by which osteochondral cells
              and their progenitors sense and respond to mechanical loading in
              vivo. In this study, hydrostatic pressure regimes of 0-279kPa at
              0.005-2Hz were applied to organotypically cultured ex vivo chick
              foetal femurs (e11) for 1hour per day in a custom designed
              bioreactor for 14days and bone formation assessed by X-ray
              microtomography and qualified by histology. We found that the
              mineralised portion of the developing femur cultured under any
              cyclic hydrostatic pressure regime was significantly larger
              and/or denser than unstimulated controls but that constant
              (non-cycling) hydrostatic pressure had no effect on bone growth.
              Further experiments showed that the increase in bone formation
              was directly proportional to stimulation frequency (R(2)=0.917),
              but independent of the magnitude of the pressure applied, whilst
              even very low frequencies of stimulation (0.005Hz) had
              significant effects on bone growth. Expression of Type-II
              collagen in both epiphyses and diaphysis was significantly
              upregulated (1.48-fold and 1.95-fold respectively), together with
              osteogenic genes (osteonectin and osteopontin) and the osteocyte
              maturation marker CD44. This work demonstrates that cyclic
              hydrostatic pressure promotes bone growth and mineralisation in a
              developmental model and supports the hypothesis that hydrostatic

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Physical loading is necessary to maintain bone tissue
              integrity. Loading-induced fluid shear is recognised as one of
              the most potent bone micromechanical cues and has been shown to
              direct stem cell osteogenesis. However, the effect of pressure
              transients, which drive fluid flow, on human bone marrow stem
              cell (hBMSC) osteogenesis is undetermined. Therefore, the
              objective of the study is to employ a systematic analysis of
              cyclic hydrostatic pressure (CHP) parameters predicted to occur
              in vivo on early hBMSC osteogenic responses and late-stage
              osteogenic lineage commitment. METHODS: hBMSC were exposed to CHP
              of 10 kPa, 100 kPa and 300 kPa magnitudes at frequencies of 0.5
              Hz, 1 Hz and 2 Hz for 1 h, 2 h and 4 h of stimulation, and the
              effect on early osteogenic gene expression of COX2, RUNX2 and OPN
              was determined. Moreover, to decipher whether CHP can induce stem
              cell lineage commitment, hBMSCs were stimulated for 4 days for 2
              h/day using 10 kPa, 100 kPa and 300 kPa pressures at 2 Hz
              frequency and cultured statically for an additional 1-2 weeks.
              Pressure-induced osteogenesis was quantified based on ATP
              release, collagen synthesis and mineral deposition. RESULTS: CHP
              elicited a positive, but variable, early osteogenic response in
              hBMSCs in a magnitude- and frequency-dependent manner, that is
              gene specific. COX2 expression elicited magnitude-dependent
              effects which were not present for RUNX2 or OPN mRNA expression.
              However, the most robust pro-osteogenic response was found at the
              highest magnitude (300 kPa) and frequency regimes (2 Hz).
              Interestingly, long-term mechanical stimulation utilising 2 Hz
              frequency elicited a magnitude-dependent release of ATP; however,
              all magnitudes promoted similar levels of collagen synthesis and
              significant mineral deposition, demonstrating that lineage
              commitment is magnitude independent. This therefore demonstrates
              that physiological levels of pressures, as low as 10 kPa, within
              the bone can drive hBMSC osteogenic lineage commitment.
              CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings demonstrate an important role
              for cyclic hydrostatic pressure in hBMSCs and bone
              mechanobiology, which should be considered when studying
              pressure-driven fluid shear effects in hBMSCs mechanobiology.
              Moreover, these findings may have clinical implication in terms

              faith in the efficacy of bone growth stimulators on behalf of
              clinicians. The purpose of this narrative review is to examine
              the preclinical body of literature supporting electrical
              stimulation and its effect on bone properties and elucidate gaps
              in clinical translation with an emphasis on device specifications
              and mechanisms of action. When examining these studies, trends
              become apparent. In vitro and small animal studies are successful
              in inducing osteogenesis with all electrical stimulation
              modalities: direct current, pulsed electromagnetic field, and
              capacitive coupling. However, large animal studies are largely
              unsuccessful with the non-invasive modalities. This may be due to
              issues of scale and thickness of tissue planes with varying
              levels of resistivity, not present in small animal models.
              Additionally, it is difficult to draw conclusions from studies
              due to the varying units of stimulation strength and stimulation
              protocols and incomplete device specification reporting. To
              better understand the disconnect between the large and small
              animal model, the authors recommend increasing scientific rigor
              for these studies and reporting a novel minimum set of parameters
              depending on the stimulation modality.",

              aims to investigate the initial mechanism of action by
              characterising the physical and chemical changes in the
              extracellular environment during ES and correlate them with the
              responses of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Computational
              modelling was used to estimate the electrical potentials relative
              to the cathode and the current density across the cell monolayer.
              We showed expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, c-FOS, c-JUN, and
              SPP1 mRNAs, as well as the increased metabolic activities of MSCs
              at different time points. Moreover, the average of 2.5 $\mu$M of
              H2O2 and 34 $\mu$g/L of dissolved Pt were measured from the
              electrically stimulated media (ES media), which also corresponded
              with the increases in SPP1 mRNA expression and cell metabolic
              activities. The addition of sodium pyruvate to the ES media as an

              eliminated an increase in cell metabolic activities induced by ES
              media treatment. These findings suggest that H2O2 was influencing
              cell metabolic activity, whereas SPP1 mRNA expression was

              cell communication and behavior. Electrically charged ions
              transported across cell membranes maintain an electrochemical
              imbalance that gives rise to bioelectric signaling, called
              membrane potential or Vmem. Vmem plays a key role in numerous
              inter- and intracellular functions that regulate cell behaviors
              like proliferation, differentiation and migration, all playing a
              critical role in embryonic development, healing, and
              regeneration. Methods: With the goal of analyzing the changes in
              Vmem during cell proliferation and differentiation, here we used
              direct current electrical stimulation (EStim) to promote cell
              proliferation and differentiation and simultaneously tracked the
              corresponding changes in Vmem in adipose derived mesenchymal stem

              AT-MSC proliferation that corresponded to Vmem depolarization and
              increased osteogenic differentiation that corresponded to Vmem
              hyperpolarization. Taken together, this shows that Vmem changes

              lineage commitment are a rapidly expanding field of interest.
              Recently, nanoscale mechanical stimulation of mesenchymal stem
              cells (MSCs) has been shown to activate mechanotransduction
              pathways stimulating osteogenesis in 2D and 3D culture. This has
              the potential to revolutionise bone graft procedures by creating
              cellular graft material from autologous or allogeneic sources of
              MSCs without using chemical induction. With the increased
              interest in mechanical stimulation of cells and huge potential
              for clinical use, it is apparent that researchers and clinicians
              require a scalable bioreactor system that provides consistently
              reproducible results with a simple turnkey approach. A novel
              bioreactor system is presented that consists of: a bioreactor
              vibration plate, calibrated and optimised for nanometre
              vibrations at 1 kHz, a power supply unit, which supplies a 1 kHz
              sine wave signal necessary to generate approximately 30 nm of
              vibration amplitude, and custom 6-well cultureware with toroidal
              shaped magnets incorporated in the base of each well for
              conformal attachment to the bioreactor's magnetic vibration
              plate. The cultureware and vibration plate were designed using
              finite element analysis to determine the modal and harmonic
              responses, and validated by interferometric measurement. This
              helps ensure that the vibration plate and cultureware, and thus
              collagen and MSCs, all move as a rigid body, avoiding large
              deformations close to the resonant frequency of the vibration
              plate and vibration damping beyond the resonance. Assessment of
              osteogenic protein expression was performed to confirm
              differentiation of MSCs after initial biological experiments with
              the system, as well as atomic force microscopy of the 3D gel
              constructs during vibrational stimulation to verify that strain
              hardening of the gel did not occur. This shows that cell
              differentiation was the result of the nanovibrational stimulation
              provided by the bioreactor alone, and that other cell
              differentiating factors, such as stiffening of the collagen gel,
              did not contribute.",

              multipotent cells that are widely applied in regenerative
              medicine. Electrical stimulation (ES) has a promoting effect on
              bone healing and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Direct and
              alternating currents (AC) are extensively used to promote the
              osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vivo and in vitro. However,
              information on conducting effective differentiation remains
              scarce. In this paper, we propose a method to optimize ES
              parameters based on calcium spike patterns of MSCs. Calcium spike
              frequency decreases as the osteogenic differentiation of MSC
              progresses. Furthermore, we tested various ES parameters through
              the real-time monitoring of calcium spike patterns. We
              efficiently initiated the process of osteogenic differentiation
              in MSCs by using the optimal parameters of AC, including voltage,
              signal shapes, frequency, and duty time. This method provides a
              new approach to optimize osteogenic differentiation and is

              events, from maintaining cellular homeostasis to embryonic
              development to healing. The application of electric fields offers
              substantial therapeutic potential, while optimal dosing regimens
              and the underlying mechanisms responsible for the positive
              clinical impact are poorly understood. METHODS: The purpose of
              this study was to track the differentiation profile and stress
              response of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells
              (hMSCs) undergoing osteogenic differentiation during exposure to
              a 20 mV/cm, 60 kHz electric field. Morphological and biochemical
              changes were imaged using endogenous two-photon excited
              fluorescence (TPEF) and quantitatively assessed through
              eccentricity calculations and extraction of the redox ratio from
              NADH, FAD and lipofuscin contributions. Real time reverse
              transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were used to
              track osteogenic differentiation markers, namely alkaline
              phosphatase (ALP) and collagen type 1 (col1), and stress response
              markers, such as heat shock protein 27 (hsp27) and heat shock
              protein 70 (hsp70). Comparisons of collagen deposition between
              the stimulated hMSCs and controls were examined through second
              harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. RESULTS: Quantitative
              differences in cell morphology, as described through an
              eccentricity ratio, were found on days 2 and days 5 (p < 0.05) in
              samples exposed to the electric field. A delayed but two fold
              increase in ALP and col1 transcript was detected by week 2 (p <
              0.05) in differentiating hMSCs exposed to an electric field in
              comparison to the nonstimulated controls. Upregulation in stress
              marker, hsp27, and type 1 collagen deposition were correlated
              with this response. Increases in NADH, FAD, and lipofuscin were
              traced in the stimulation group during the first week of field
              exposure with differences statistically significant on day 10 (p
              < 0.05). Changes in hsp27 expression correlate well with changes
              in lipofuscin detected in the stimulation group, suggesting a
              connection with oxidative stress. Both differentiation factors
              and electrical stimulation improved hMSC differentiation
              potential to bone based on calcium deposition on day 28.
              CONCLUSIONS: Electrical stimulation is a useful tool to improve
              hMSC osteogenic differentiation, while heat shock proteins may
              reveal underlying mechanisms, and optical non-invasive imaging
              may be used to monitor the induced morphological and biochemical

              acid-polyethylene glycol (PLA/PEG) composite scaffolds. METHODS:
              The composite scaffolds with different weight ratios of PLA and
              PEG were prepared using solvent casting-particulate leaching
              technique. Human umbilcal card blood MSCs were cultured under

              distribution over the scaffolds was confirmed with fluorescent
              microscopy. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium mineralization,
              and collagen formation were found to be higher in PLA90 scaffolds

  abstract  = "The direct targets of extremely low and microwave frequency
               range electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in producing non-thermal
               effects have not been clearly established. However, studies in
               the literature, reviewed here, provide substantial support for
               such direct targets. Twenty-three studies have shown that
               voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) produce these and other
               EMF effects, such that the L-type or other VGCC blockers block
               or greatly lower diverse EMF effects. Furthermore, the
               voltage-gated properties of these channels may provide
               biophysically plausible mechanisms for EMF biological effects.
               Downstream responses of such EMF exposures may be mediated
               through Ca(2+) /calmodulin stimulation of nitric oxide
               synthesis. Potentially, physiological/therapeutic responses may
               be largely as a result of nitric oxide-cGMP-protein kinase G
               pathway stimulation. A well-studied example of such an apparent
               therapeutic response, EMF stimulation of bone growth, appears to
               work along this pathway. However, pathophysiological responses
               to EMFs may be as a result of nitric
               oxide-peroxynitrite-oxidative stress pathway of action. A single
               such well-documented example, EMF induction of DNA single-strand
               breaks in cells, as measured by alkaline comet assays, is
               reviewed here. Such single-strand breaks are known to be
               produced through the action of this pathway. Data on the
               mechanism of EMF induction of such breaks are limited; what data
               are available support this proposed mechanism. Other Ca(2+)
               -mediated regulatory changes, independent of nitric oxide, may
               also have roles. This article reviews, then, a substantially
               supported set of targets, VGCCs, whose stimulation produces
               non-thermal EMF responses by humans/higher animals with
               downstream effects involving Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent nitric
               oxide increases, which may explain therapeutic and

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Since electrical stimulation (ES) can significantly
              accelerate bone healing, a conductive scaffold that can deliver
              ES locally at the defect site is desirable for bone defect
              therapy. Herein, an electrically conductive scaffold was prepared
              via incorporation of polypyrrole (PPY) in a polycaprolactone
              (PCL) template scaffold. In vitro tests with mouse osteoblasts
              indicate that the PPY/PCL scaffold has good biocompatibility, and
              is suitable for use as an ES substrate. When human
              adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) were cultured in
              the PPY/PCL scaffold and subjected to 200 $\mu$A of direct
              current for 4h per day for 21 days, the amount of calcium
              deposited was 100 percent higher than that without ES. When these cells
              were subjected to ES together with blockers of voltage-gated
              calcium (Ca(2+)v), sodium (Na(+)v), potassium (K(+)v), or
              chloride (Cl(-)v) channels, the ES-induced enhancement of
              AD-MSCs' functions was reduced with Na(+)v, K(+)v, or Cl(-)v
              blockers and completely nullified with Ca(2+)v blocker. These
              results indicate that ion fluxes through these channels activated
              by ES induce different cascades of reactions in the cells, which
              subsequently regulate AD-MSCs' functions, and Ca(2+)v plays a
              more critical role than the other three channels. Our results
              further the current understanding of the mechanisms by which ES
              regulates stem cells' behavior, and also showed that the
              conductive PPY/PCL scaffold with application of ES has good
              potential in bone defect therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In
              this work, an electrically conductive and biocompatible scaffold
              was prepared by incorporating polypyrrole in a polycaprolactone
              template scaffold. Application of 200 $\mu$A direct current for
              4h per day to human adipose derived-mesenchymal stem cells
              cultured on this scaffold promoted migration of these cells into
              the inner region of the scaffold and enhanced their osteogenic
              differentiation. The roles of voltage-gated ion channels
              (Ca(2+)v, Na(+)v, K(+)v and Cl(-)v) in osteogenic differentiation
              stimulated by the electric current were investigated. The results
              from these experiments further the current understanding of the
              mechanisms by which electrical stimulation regulates stem cells'
              behavior, and also show that the polypyrrole-polycaprolactone

              mechanism of action of BEC in osteoblast differentiation and
              cytokine production in human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs).
              Using an in vitro culture system with a modified version of the
              BEC stimulator chip used in our previous study, we exposed hMSCs
              to a 100 Hz ES with a magnitude of 1.5/15 muA/cm(2) for 250/25
              mus. hMSCs showed increased proliferation during static BEC
              stimulation for 5 days. However, alkaline phosphatase activity
              and calcium deposition were enhanced in hMSCs 7 days after the
              stimulation, rather than during the period of ES. BEC induced
              vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and BMP-2 production;
              the former can enhance the proliferation of human umbilical vein
              endothelial cells in culture using conditioned media from BEC
              cultures. Treatment with selective inhibitors of p38 MAPK
              (SB203580) or Erk (PD98059), as well as calcium channel blockers
              (verapamil and nifedipine), reduced the BEC-mediated increase of
              VEGF expression and cell proliferation. These findings reveal
              that BEC is involved in the osteoblast differentiation of hMSCs
              through enhancement of cell proliferation and modulation of the
              local endocrine environment through VEGF and BMP-2 induction
              through the activation of MAPK (Erk and p38) and the calcium
              channel. Thus, local stimulation using BEC might be most
              beneficial in promoting osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs,

              Electric-field-induced calcium uptake was shown to depend on the

              the anode or to the cathode. An increased calcium uptake was
              observed when the bone cells adhered to the substratum which was

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Electrical stimulation is used to treat nonunions and
              to augment spinal fusions. We studied the biochemical pathways
              that are activated in signal transduction when various types of
              electrical stimulation are applied to bone cells. METHODS:
              Cultured MC3T3-E1 bone cells were exposed to capacitive coupling,
              inductive coupling, or combined electromagnetic fields at
              appropriate field strengths for thirty minutes and for two, six,
              and twenty-four hours. The DNA content of each dish was
              determined. Other cultures of MC3T3-E1 bone cells were exposed to
              capacitive coupling, inductive coupling, or combined
              electromagnetic fields for two hours in the presence of various
              inhibitors of signal transduction, with or without electrical
              stimulation, and the DNA content of each dish was determined.
              RESULTS: All three signals produced a significant increase in DNA
              content per dish compared with that in the controls at all
              time-points (p < 0.05), but only exposure to capacitive coupling
              resulted in a significant, ever-increasing DNA production at each
              time-period beyond thirty minutes. The use of specific metabolic
              inhibitors indicated that, with capacitive coupling, signal
              transduction was by means of influx of Ca(2+) through
              voltage-gated calcium channels leading to an increase in
              cytosolic Ca(2+) (blocked by verapamil), cytoskeletal calmodulin
              (blocked by W-7), and prostaglandin E2 (blocked by indomethacin).
              With inductive coupling and combined electromagnetic fields,
              signal transduction was by means of intracellular release of
              Ca(2+) leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) (blocked by
              TMB-8) and an increase in activated cytoskeletal calmodulin
              (blocked by W-7). CONCLUSIONS: The initial events in signal
              transduction were found to be different when capacitive coupling
              was compared with inductive coupling and with combined
              electromagnetic fields; the initial event with capacitive
              coupling is Ca(2+) ion translocation through cell-membrane
              voltage-gated calcium channels, whereas the initial event with
              inductive coupling and with combined electromagnetic fields is
              the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. The final
              pathway, however, is the same for all three signals-that is,
              there is an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) and an increase in
              activated cytoskeletal calmodulin.",

              successfully used in the treatment of bone nonunions and to
              effect spinal fusions. However, the pathway of biologic events
              whereby this is accomplished has not been fully elucidated. To
              determine whether bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) could be
              involved, the effect of electrical stimulation on BMP gene
              expression was investigated. METHODS: Postconfluent cultures of
              MC3T3-E1 bone cells were exposed to a series of capacitively
              coupled signals in which the duration, amplitude, frequency, and
              duty cycle were sequentially and systematically varied. The
              cellular response was measured by quantifying the mRNA levels of
              BMP-2 through BMP-8, as well as the BMP antagonists gremlin and
              noggin, with use of reverse transcription followed by real-time
              quantitative polymerase chain reaction. BMP-2 protein was
              measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and alkaline
              phosphatase activity was measured by a specific colorimetric
              assay. RESULTS: The results showed that BMP-2 through BMP-8,
              gremlin, and noggin were all normally expressed by MC3T3-E1
              cells, and could be significantly up-regulated by specific and
              selective capacitively coupled electric fields (p < 0.05).
              However, mRNA expression for BMP-2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 was
              consistently up-regulated several times higher than that for
              BMP-3 and BMP-8, gremlin, and noggin under identical conditions.
              Concomitantly, BMP-2 protein production and alkaline phosphatase

              electrically stimulated cultures (p = 0.001 and p < 0.01,

              optimal capacitively coupled signal (60 kHz, 20 mV/cm at a 50\%
              duty cycle for twenty-four hours) can specifically, selectively,

              understanding of the molecular framework that controls osteogenic

              regulating bone development. A partial list of these factors
              includes the Wnt/beta-catenin, TGF-beta/BMP, FGF, Notch and
              Hedgehog signaling pathways, and Runx2, Osterix, ATF4, TAZ, and
              NFATc1 transcriptional factors. A better understanding of
              molecular mechanisms behind osteogenic differentiation would not
              only help us to identify pathogenic causes of bone and skeletal
              diseases but also lead to the development of targeted therapies

              platform to study the effects of different sustained (12 hours
              galvanostatic DC) EF configurations on wound closure dynamics.
              Specifically, we compared if electrotactically closing a wound's
              gap from one wound edge (i.e., uni-directional EF) is as
              effective as compared to alternatingly polarizing both the
              wound's edges (i.e., pseudo-converging EF) as both of these
              spatial stimulation strategies are fundamental to the eventual
              translational electrode design and strategy. We found that
              uni-directional electric guidance cues were superior in group

              stress on osteocyte bodies and processes consists of both steady
              and oscillatory components. In this study, we investigated and
              compared the intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses of
              osteocytic networks under steady and oscillatory fluid flows. An
              in vitro osteocytic network was built with MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like
              cells using micro-patterning techniques to simulate the in vivo
              orderly organization of osteocyte networks. Sinusoidal
              oscillating fluid flow or unidirectional steady flow was applied
              on the cell surface with 2Pa peak shear stress. It was found that
              the osteocytic networks were significantly more responsive to
              steady flow than to oscillatory flow. The osteocytes can release
              more calcium peaks with higher magnitudes at a faster speed under
              steady flow stimulation. The [Ca(2+)](i) signaling transients
              under the steady and oscillatory flows have significantly
              different spatiotemporal characters, but a similar responsive
              percentage of cells. Further signaling pathway studies using
              inhibitors showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store,
              extracellular calcium source, ATP, PGE(2) and NO related pathways
              play similar roles in the [Ca(2+)](i) signaling of osteocytes
              under either steady or oscillating flow. The spatiotemporal
              characteristics of [Ca(2+)](i) transients under oscillating fluid
              flow are affected more profoundly by pharmacological treatments
              than under the steady flow. Our findings support the hypothesis
              that the [Ca(2+)](i) responses of osteocytic networks are
              significantly dependent on the profiles of fluid flow.",

              is crucial for vertebrate movement. Bone cell mechanotransduction
              is facilitated by a number of cell biological pathways, one of

              co-receptor Lrp5 has been identified as a crucial protein for
              mechanical signaling in bone, and modifiers of Lrp5 activity play
              important roles in mediating signaling efficiency through Lrp5,
              including sclerostin, Dkk1, and the co-receptor Lrp4. Mechanical
              regulation of sclerostin is mediated by certain members of the

              of which are mechanoresponsive-are coming to light, including
              R-spondins and their role in organizing the Rnf43/Znrf3 and

              beneficial for the transport of cells during cell seeding.
              Nonetheless, the fact that cells penetrate into the scaffold
              pores does not necessarily imply the interception of cells with
              scaffold substrate and cell attachment. An in vitro perfusion
              system was built to relate the selected flow rate with seeding
              efficiency. However, the in vitro model does not elucidate how
              the flow rate affects the transport and deposition of cells onto
              the scaffold. Thus, a computational model was developed mimicking
              in vitro conditions to identify the mechanisms that bring cells
              to the scaffold from suspension flow. Static and dynamic cell
              seeding configurations were investigated. In static seeding,
              cells sediment due to gravity until they encounter the first
              obstacle. In dynamic seeding, 12, 120 and 600 [Formula: see text]
              flow rates were explored under the presence or the absence of
              gravity. Gravity and secondary flow were found to be key factors
              for cell deposition. In vitro and in silico seeding efficiencies
              are in the same order of magnitude and follow the same trend with
              the effect of fluid flow; static seeding results in higher
              efficiency than dynamic perfusion although irregular spatial
              distribution of cells was found. In dynamic seeding, 120
              [Formula: see text] provided the best seeding results.
              Nevertheless, the perfusion approach reports low efficiencies for
              the scaffold used in this study which leads to cell waste and low
              density of cells inside the scaffold. This study suggests gravity
              and secondary flow as the driving mechanisms for cell-scaffold
              deposition. In addition, the present in silico model can help to

              cell biological effects which are ascribed to electric fields
              (EF), magnetic fields (MF) and electromagnetic fields (EMF). In
              recent years, a change in paradigm took place concerning the
              endogenously produced static EF of cells and tissues. Here,
              modern molecular biology could link the action of ion
              transporters and ion channels to the ``electric'' action of cells
              and tissues. Also, sensing of these mainly EF could be
              demonstrated in studies of cell migration and wound healing. The
              triggers exerted by ion concentrations and concomitant electric
              field gradients have been traced along signaling cascades till
              gene expression changes in the nucleus. Far more enigmatic is the
              way of action of static MF which come in most cases from outside
              (e.g. earth magnetic field). All systems in an organism from the
              molecular to the organ level are more or less in motion. Thus, in

              combination of EF and MF normally in the range of extremely
              low-frequency EMF. Because a bewildering array of model systems

              function in a frequency-dependent manner. However, the mechanism

              systematic numerical study of a cell-field interaction following
              cell exposure to the external EF. We use a realistic experimental
              environment that also recapitulates the absence of a direct
              electric contact between the field-sourcing electrodes and the
              cells or the culture medium. We identify characteristic regimes

              by application of direct current electric fields have been
              documented, quantitative measurements of the effects of
              alternating current (ac) electric fields on [Ca2+]i are lacking

              a model cell type the [Ca2+]i response to ac electric fields.
              Application of a 1 or 10 Hz electric field to human hepatoma
              (Hep3B) cells induces a fourfold increase in [Ca2+]i (from 50 nM
              to 200 nM) within 30 min of continuous field exposure. Depletion
              of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium prevents the electric
              field-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that Ca2+ influx
              across the plasma membrane is responsible for the [Ca2+]i
              increase. Incubation of cells with the phospholipase C inhibitor
              U73122 does not inhibit ac electric field-induced increases in

              concomitant treatment with both GdCl3 and CoCl2 completely
              inhibits the field-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Since neither Gd3+
              nor Co2+ is efficiently transported across the plasma membrane,
              these data suggest that the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by ac

  abstract = "Osteoporosis is a skeletal metabolic disease characterized by
              reduced bone mass and a high susceptibility to fractures, in
              which osteoblasts and osteoclasts are highly involved in the
              abnormal bone remodeling processes. Recently, low-magnitude,
              high-frequency whole-body vibration has been demonstrated to
              significantly reduce osteopenia experimentally and clinically.
              However, the underlying mechanism regarding how osteoblastic
              activity is altered when bone tissues adapt to mechanical
              vibration remains elusive. The current study systematically
              investigated the effect and potential molecular signaling
              mechanisms in mediating the effects of mechanical vibration (0.5
              gn, 45 Hz) on primary osteoblasts in vitro. The results of the
              present study demonstrated that low-level mechanical stimulation
              promoted osteoblastic proliferation and extracellular matrix
              mineralization. In addition, it was also revealed that mechanical
              vibration induced improved cytoskeleton arrangement in primary
              osteoblasts. Furthermore, mechanical vibration resulted in
              significantly increased gene expression of alkaline phosphatase,
              bone morphogenetic protein 2 and osteoprotegerin, and suppressed
              sclerostin gene expression, as determined by reverse
              transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR)
              analyses. Mechanical vibration was observed to upregulate gene
              and protein expression levels of osteogenesis-associated
              biomarkers, including osteocalcin and Runt-related transcription
              factor 2. In addition, RTqPCR and western blotting analysis
              demonstrated that mechanical vibration promoted gene and protein
              expression of canonical Wnt signaling genes, including Wnt3a,
              low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 and
              $\beta$-catenin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated
              that mechanical vibration stimulates osteoblastic activities and
              may function through a potential canonical Wnt
              signaling-associated mechanism. These findings provided novel
              information that improves the understanding of the molecular
              mechanisms involved in osteoblastic activities in response to
              mechanical vibration, which may facilitate the scientific

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: As many researchers have focused on promoting the
              graft-bone healing of artificial ligaments, even with numerous
              chemical coatings, identifying a biosafe, effective, and
              immediately usable method is still important clinically. PURPOSE:
              (1) To determine whether a low-intensity pulsed ultrasound system
              (LIPUS) promotes in vitro cell viability and osteogenic
              differentiation and (2) to assess the applicability and
              effectiveness of LIPUS in promoting the graft-bone healing of
              artificial ligaments in vivo. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory
              study. METHODS: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets and
              grafts were randomly assigned to control and LIPUS groups.
              MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were cultured on PET sheets. Cell
              viability and morphology were evaluated using a live/dead
              viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. Alkaline
              phosphatase activity, calcium nodule formation, and Western blot
              were evaluated for osteogenic differentiation. For in vivo
              experiments, the effect of LIPUS was evaluated via an
              extra-articular graft-bone healing model in 48 rabbits: the
              osteointegration and new bone formation were tested by
              micro-computed tomography and histological staining, and the
              graft-bone bonding was tested by biomechanical testing. RESULTS:
              Cell viability was significantly higher in the LIPUS group as
              compared with control (living and dead compared between control
              and LIPUS groups, P = .0489 vs P = .0489). Better adherence of
              cells and greater development of extracellular matrix were
              observed in the LIPUS group. Furthermore, LIPUS promoted alkaline
              phosphatase activity, calcium nodule formation, and the protein
              expression of collagen 1 (P = .0002) and osteocalcin (P = .0006)
              in vitro. Micro-computed tomography revealed higher surrounding
              bone mass at 4 weeks and newly formed bone mass at 8 weeks in the
              LIPUS group (P = .0014 and P = .0018). Histological analysis
              showed a narrower interface and direct graft-bone contact in the
              LIPUS group; the surrounding bone area at 4 weeks and the mass of
              newly formed bone at 4 and 8 weeks in the LIPUS group were also
              significantly higher as compared with control (surrounding bone,
              P < .0001; newly formed bone, P = .0016 at 4 weeks and P = .005
              at 8 weeks). The ultimate failure load in the LIPUS group was
              significantly higher than in the control group (P < .0001 at 4
              weeks; P = .0008 at 8 weeks). CONCLUSION: LIPUS promoted the
              viability and osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1
              preosteoblasts in vitro and enhanced the graft-bone healing of
              PET artificial ligament in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LIPUS is an

              to disuse can inhibit osteogenesis and induce adipogenesis of
              mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Long-term bed rest due to both

              stimulation for cellular viability and osteogenesis, particularly
              under disuse conditions. The objective of this study was to
              examine the effects of low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on
              the osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived human stem
              cells (Ad-hMSC) in simulated microgravity conditions. Cells were
              cultured in a 1D clinostat to simulate microgravity (SMG) and
              treated with LIPUS at 30mW/cm(2) for 20 min/day. It was
              hypothesized that the application of LIPUS to SMG cultures would
              restore osteogenesis in Ad-hMSCs. The results showed significant
              increases in ALP, OSX, RANKL, RUNX2, and decreases in OPG in
              LIPUS treated SMG cultures of Ad-MSC compared to non-treated
              cultures. LIPUS also restored OSX, RUNX2 and RANKL expression in
              osteoblast cells. SMG significantly reduced ALP positive cells by
              70perc (p<0.01) and ALP activity by 22perc(p<0.01), while LIPUS
              treatment restored ALP positive cell number and activity to
              equivalence with normal gravity controls. Extracellular matrix
              collagen and mineralization was assessed by Sirius red and
              Alizarin red staining, respectively. SMG cultures showed little
              or no collagen or mineralization, but LIPUS treatment restored
              collagen content to 50perc (p<0.001) and mineralization by 45perc
              (p<0.001) in LIPUS treated-SMG cultures relative to SMG-only

              environment (i.e. wall shear stress: WSS) within the scaffolds is

              and osteochondral regeneration. Although human mesenchymal stem
              cells (hMSCs) offer considerable therapeutic potential, little is
              known about the molecular mechanisms that control their
              differentiation. We hypothesized that mechanical strain might be
              an inherent stimulus for chondrogenic and/or osteogenic
              differentiation in undifferentiated hMSCs, where c-Fos (FOS)
              might play a major role in mechanotransduction. METHOD: hMSCs
              from 10 donors were intermittently stimulated by cyclic tensile
              strain (CTS) at 3000 mustrain for a period of 3 days.
              Differential gene expression of strained and unstrained hMSCs was
              analysed by real-time RT-PCR for several marker genes, including
              the transcription factors FOS, RUNX2, SOX9, and others.
              Additionally, alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) was determined
              kinetically. RESULTS: The application of CTS significantly
              stimulated the expression levels of the early chondrogenic and
              osteogenic marker genes (SOX9, LUM, DCN; RUNX2, SPARC, SPP1,
              ALPL); this was accompanied by stimulation of ALP activity
              (+38\%+/-12 standard error of mean, P<0.05). Matrix analysis
              revealed that the osteo-chondrogenic response followed a
              coordinated expression pattern, in which FOS was attributed to
              early osteogenic but not chondrogenic differentiation.
              CONCLUSION: Undifferentiated hMSCs are highly sensitive to
              mechanical strain with a transcriptionally controlled

              osteogenic differentiation medium in the absence or presence of
              bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2; BMP7; GW9662, a potent

              or all of these---in the presence or absence of mechanical
              stimulation (a rotational force exerted by a microplate mixer).
              After 7, 14, and 21 days of the addition of these factors,
              osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation were analyzed using
              gene expression and histomorphometric assays. Results The results
              confirmed that culture in conditioned osteogenic differentiation

              significant increases in the osteogenic potential of ADSCs,

              versa)---that is, the initiation of turbulence---is one of the
              most important research subjects in the history of engineering.
              Even for pipe flow, predicting the onset of turbulence requires
              sophisticated instrumentation and/or direct numerical simulation,
              based on observing the instantaneous flow structure formation and
              evolution. In this work, a local Reynolds number equivalence
              $\gamma$ (ratio of local inertia effect to viscous effect) is
              seen to conform to the Universal Law of the Wall, where $\gamma$
              = 1 represents a quantitative balance between the abovementioned
              two effects. This coincides with the wall layer thickness (y+ =
              1, where y+ is the dimensionless distance from the wall surface
              defined in the Universal Law of the Wall). It is found that the
              characteristic of how the local derivative of $\gamma$ against
              the local velocity changes with increasing velocity determines
              the onset of turbulence. For pipe flow, $\gamma$ $\approx$ 25,
              and for plate flow, $\gamma$ $\approx$ 151.5. These findings
              suggest that a certain combination of $\gamma$ and velocity
              (nonlinearity) can qualify the source of turbulence (i.e.,
              generate turbulent energy). Similarly, a re-evaluation of the
              previous findings reveals that only the geometrically narrow
              domain can act locally as the source of turbulence, with the rest
              of the flow field largely being left for transporting and
              dissipating. This understanding will have an impact on the future

              distributions in the solid material phase and fluid velocity,

              filled of fluid, by means of micro computed tomographed
              (CT)-based finite element (FE) models. Two samples of porous
              materials, one of calcium phosphate-based cement and another of
              biodegradable glass, were used. Compressive loads equivalent to
              0.5p of compression applied to the solid material phase and
              interstitial fluid flows with inlet velocities of 1, 10 and 100
              microm/s applied to the interconnected pores were simulated,
              changing also the inlet side and the viscosity of the medium.
              Similar strain distributions for both materials were found, with
              compressive and tensile strain maximal values of 1.6p and 0.6p,
              respectively. Mean values were consistent with the applied
              deformation. When 10 microm/s of inlet fluid velocity and 1.45
              Pas viscosity, maximal values of fluid velocity were 12.76 mm/s
              for CaP cement and 14.87 mm/s for glass. Mean values were
              consistent with the inlet ones applied, and mean values of shear
              stress were around 5 x 10(-5)Pa. Variations on inlet fluid
              velocity and fluid viscosity produce proportional and independent
              changes in fluid velocity, fluid shear stress and fluid pressure.
              This study has shown how mechanical loads and fluid flow applied

              of media flow rate and dynamic viscosity, bioreactor

              used the Lattice-Boltzmann method to simulate the flow conditions

              pre-osteoblasts than PFFlow. 3D-simulation demonstrated that
              dependent on inlet flow rate, fluid velocity reached a maximum
              (50--1200 $\mu$m/s) between scaffold-strands, and fluid shear
              stress (0.5--4 mPa) and wall shear stress (0.5--20 mPa) on
              scaffold-strands surfaces. At all inlet flow rates, gauge fluid
              pressure and oxygen-concentration were similar. The simulated
              cell proliferation and distribution, and oxygen-concentration

              shear stress inside 3D-printed scaffolds, but not gauge fluid

              which voltage gradients regulate cell behaviors and the assembly
              of complex large-scale structures. A recent paper demonstrated
              that a specific voltage range is necessary for demarcation of eye
              fields in the frog embryo. Remarkably, artificially setting other
              somatic cells to the eye-specific voltage range resulted in
              formation of eyes in aberrant locations, including tissues that
              are not in the normal anterior ectoderm lineage: eyes could be
              formed in the gut, on the tail, or in the lateral plate mesoderm.
              These data challenge the existing models of eye fate restriction

              of knowledge in developmental bioelectricity, proposes three
              possible interpretations of the bioelectric code that
              functionally maps physiological states to anatomical outcomes,

              used to treat bone defects clinically. Recently, both cellular
              and molecular approaches have demonstrated that ES can change
              cell behavior such as migration, proliferation and
              differentiation. METHODS: In the present study we exposed rat
              bone marrow- (BM-) and adipose tissue- (AT-) derived mesenchymal
              stem cells (MSCs) to direct current electrical stimulation (DC
              ES) and assessed temporal changes in osteogenic differentiation.
              We applied 100 mV/mm of DC ES for 1 h per day for three, seven
              and 14 days to cells cultivated in osteogenic differentiation
              medium and assessed viability and calcium deposition at the
              different time points. In addition, expression of osteogenic
              genes, Runx2, Osteopontin, and Col1A2 was assessed in BM- and
              AT-derived MSCs at the different time points. RESULTS: Results
              showed that ES changed osteogenic gene expression patterns in
              both BM- and AT-MSCs, and these changes differed between the two
              groups. In BM-MSCs, ES caused a significant increase in mRNA
              levels of Runx2, Osteopontin and Col1A2 at day 7, while in
              AT-MSCs, the increase in Runx2 and Osteopontin expression were
              observed after 14 days of ES. DISCUSSION: This study shows that
              rat bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived stem cells react
              differently to electrical stimuli, an observation that could be

                   an electrode. The difference between the two processes is
                   clearly discussed in several classical sources, starting
                   with Grahame (1952). However, later reference to charge
                   transfer across the metal-solution interface as a defining
                   feature of a Faradaic process, has led to ambiguities.
                   Following Grahame, in a Faradaic process, charged particles
                   transfer across the electrode, from one bulk phase to
                   another. Thus, in a Faradaic process, after applying a
                   constant current, the electrode charge, voltage and
                   composition go to constant values. Instead, in a
                   non-Faradaic (capacitive) process, charge is progressively
                   stored. We characterize the intercalation material nickel
                   hexacyanoferrate by two electrochemical methods and compare
                   with theory. Data for the capacitance of this material is
                   well described by the extended Frumkin isotherm. This data,
                   and the correspondence with theory, demonstrates that this
                   is a capacitive material and ion and charge storage in this
                   material a non-Faradaic electrode process. Cyclic
                   Voltammetry (CV) diagrams for this material have broad peaks
                   for certain potential windows, and rectangular shapes for
                   other conditions, both experimentally and in theoretical
                   calculations based on a RC network model that includes how
                   capacitance is a function of charge. Measured and predicted
                   CV diagrams are in perfect agreement with one another. This
                   shows that (broad) peaks in CV diagrams do not establish

              consistent among two cell types. It is also found that Spp1

              used in combination with electrical stimulation to promote
              multiple cellular outcomes, like differentiation and

              requires a deeper study. By performing numerical analysis in a

              effects of the scaffold presence on the electric field,
              considering multiple combinations of scaffold and culture medium

              was determined by the difference in electrical conductivity of
              these two materials. The numerical simulations pointed to
              significant variations in local electric field patterns, which

              coupled capacitively or semi-capacitively to primary

              of 350 microV (semi-capacitive coupled mode) across the

              activities including cytotoxicity, proliferation, cell-kinetics

              of cells in S phase and G(2)/M phase as shown by cell cycle

              compared to other types of ES. Application of DW or CC to the

              as stimuli to manipulate cell growth, preferential orientation
              and bone remodelling. In this study, commercially pure titanium
              discs were utilised in combination with a custom-built bioreactor
              to investigate the cellular responses of human mesenchymal stem
              cells via in-vitro functional assays. Finite element analysis
              revealed the homogeneous delivery of electric field in the
              bioreactor chamber with no detection of current density
              fluctuation in the proposed model. The custom-built bioreactor
              with capacitive stimulation delivery system features long-term
              stimulation with homogeneous electric field, biocompatible,
              sterilisable, scalable design and cost-effective in the
              manufacturing process. Using a continuous stimulation regime of
              100 and 200 mV/mm on cp Ti discs, viability tests revealed up to
              an approximately 5-fold increase of cell proliferation rate as
              compared to non-stimulated controls. The human mesenchymal stem
              cells showed more elongated and differentiated morphology under
              this regime, with evidence of nuclear elongation and cytoskeletal
              orientation perpendicular to the direction of electric field. The
              continuous stimulation did not cause pH fluctuations and hydrogen
              peroxide production caused by Faradic reactions, signifying the
              suitability for long-term toxic free stimulation as opposed to
              the commonly used direct stimulation regime. An approximate of
              4-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase production and
              approximately 9-fold increase of calcium deposition were observed
              on 200 mV/mm exposed samples relative to non-stimulated controls.
              It is worth noting that early stem cell differentiation and
              matrix production were observed under the said electric field
              even without the presence of chemical inductive growth factors.
              STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript presents a study on
              combining pure titanium (primarily preferred as medical implant
              materials) and electrical stimulation in a purpose-built
              bioreactor with capacitive stimulation delivery system. A
              continuous capacitive stimulation regime on titanium disc has
              resulted in enhanced stem cell orientation, nuclei elongation,
              proliferation and differentiation as compared to non-stimulated
              controls. We believe that this manuscript creates a paradigm for

A novel type of electroactive biomaterial, the conductive polymer, promises to become one such material. Conductive polymers are already used in fuel cells, computer displays and microsurgical tools, and are now finding applications in the field of biomaterials. These versatile polymers can be synthesised alone, as hydrogels, combined into composites or electrospun into microfibres. They can be created to be biocompatible and biodegradable. Their physical properties can easily be optimized for a specific application through binding biologically important molecules into the polymer using one of the many available methods for their functionalization. Their conductive nature allows cells or tissue cultured upon them to be stimulated, the polymers’ own physical properties to be influenced post-synthesis and the drugs bound in them released, through the application of an electrical signal. It is thus little wonder that these polymers are becoming very important materials for biosensors, neural implants, drug delivery devices and tissue engineering scaffolds. Focusing mainly on polypyrrole, polyaniline and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), we review conductive polymers from the perspective of tissue engineering. The basic properties of conductive polymers, their chemical and electrochemical synthesis, the phenomena underlying their conductivity and the ways to tailor their properties (functionalization, composites, etc.) are discussed."

ABSTRACT = {Cartilage regeneration is a clinical challenge. In recent years, hydrogels have emerged as implantable scaffolds in cartilage tissue engineering. Similarly, electrical stimulation has been employed to improve matrix synthesis of cartilage cells, and thus to foster engineering and regeneration of cartilage tissue. The combination of hydrogels and electrical stimulation may pave the way for new clinical treatment of cartilage lesions. To find the optimal electric properties of hydrogels, theoretical considerations and corresponding numerical simulations are needed to identify well-suited initial parameters for experimental studies. We present the theoretical analysis of a hydrogel in a frequently used electrical stimulation device for cartilage regeneration and tissue engineering. By means of equivalent circuits, finite element analysis, and uncertainty quantification, we elucidate the influence of the geometric and dielectric properties of cell-seeded hydrogels on the capacitive-coupling electrical field stimulation. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of cellular organisation inside the hydrogel due to forces generated by the external electric field. The introduced methodology is easily reusable by other researchers and allows to directly develop novel electrical stimulation study designs. Thus, this study paves the way for the design of future experimental studies using electrically conductive hydrogels and electrical stimulation for tissue engineering.},

In recent years, a change in paradigm took place concerning the endogenously produced static EF of cells and tissues. Here, modern molecular biology could link the action of ion transporters and ion channels to the “electric” action of cells and tissues. Also, sensing of these mainly EF could be demonstrated in studies of cell migration and wound healing. The triggers exerted by ion concentrations and concomitant electric field gradients have been traced along signaling cascades till gene expression changes in the nucleus. Far more enigmatic is the way of action of static MF which come in most cases from outside (e.g. earth magnetic field). All systems in an organism from the molecular to the organ level are more or less in motion. Thus, in living tissue we mostly find alternating fields as well as combination of EF and MF normally in the range of extremely low-frequency EMF. Because a bewildering array of model systems and clinical devices exits in the EMF field we concentrate on cell biological findings and look for basic principles in the EF, MF and EMF action. As an outlook for future research topics, this review tries to link areas of EF, MF and EMF research to thermodynamics and quantum physics, approaches that will produce novel insights into cell biology."

We have recently demonstrated that a physiological electric field (EF) applied wirelessly can regulate intracellular signalling and cell function in a frequency-dependent manner. However, the mechanism for such regulation is not well understood. Here, we present a systematic numerical study of a cell-field interaction following cell exposure to the external EF. We use a realistic experimental environment that also recapitulates the absence of a direct electric contact between the field-sourcing electrodes and the cells or the culture medium. We identify characteristic regimes and present their classification with respect to frequency, location, and the electrical properties of the model components. The results show a striking difference in the frequency dependence of EF penetration and cell response between cells suspended in an electrolyte and cells attached to a substrate. The EF structure in the cell is strongly inhomogeneous and is sensitive to the physical properties of the cell and its environment. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms for frequency-dependent cell responses to EF that regulate cell function, which may have important implications for EF-based therapies and biotechnology development. }

Muscle tissue injuries would not only result in the physical and psychological pain and disability to the patient, but also become a severe social problem due to the heavy financial burden they laid on the governments. Current treatments for muscle tissue injuries all have their own severe limitations and muscle tissue engineering has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat with this problem. Conductive biomaterials are good candidates as scaffolds in muscle tissue engineering due to their proper conductivity and their promotion on muscle tissue formation. However, a review of conductive biomaterials function in muscle tissue engineering, including the skeletal muscle tissue, cardiac muscle tissue and smooth muscle tissue regeneration is still lacking. Here we reviewed the recent progress of conductive biomaterials for muscle regeneration. The recent synthesis and fabrication methods of conductive scaffolds containing conductive polymers (mainly polyaniline, polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), carbon-based nanomaterials (mainly graphene and carbon nanotube), and metal-based biomaterials were systematically discussed, and their application in a variety of forms (such as hydrogels, films, nanofibers, and porous scaffolds) for different kinds of muscle tissues formation (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and smooth muscle) were summarized.

              conductive polymer, promises to become one such material.
              Conductive polymers are already used in fuel cells, computer
              displays and microsurgical tools, and are now finding
              applications in the field of biomaterials. These versatile
              polymers can be synthesised alone, as hydrogels, combined into
              composites or electrospun into microfibres. They can be created
              to be biocompatible and biodegradable. Their physical properties
              can easily be optimized for a specific application through
              binding biologically important molecules into the polymer using
              one of the many available methods for their functionalization.
              Their conductive nature allows cells or tissue cultured upon them
              to be stimulated, the polymers' own physical properties to be
              influenced post-synthesis and the drugs bound in them released,
              through the application of an electrical signal. It is thus
              little wonder that these polymers are becoming very important
              materials for biosensors, neural implants, drug delivery devices
              and tissue engineering scaffolds. Focusing mainly on polypyrrole,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravascular injection of mesenchymal
              stem cells (MSCs) has been found to cause considerable vascular
              obstructions which may lead to serious outcomes, particularly
              after intra-arterial injection. However, the underlying
              mechanisms have been poorly understood. METHODS: In this study,
              we fractionated MSCs that had been cultured in monolayer for six
              passages into small (average diameter = 17.9 $\mu$m) and large
              (average diameter 30.4 $\mu$m) populations according to their
              sizes, and examined their vascular obstructions after
              intra-internal carotid artery injection in rats and mice in
              comparison with MSCs derived from 3D spheroids which were
              uniformly smaller in size (average diameter 12.6 $\mu$m).
              RESULTS: We found that 3D MSCs did not cause detectable infarct
              in the brain as evidenced by MRI scan and TTC stain, 2D MSCs in
              small size caused a microinfarct in one of five animals, which
              was co-localized to the area of entrapped MSCs (labeled with
              DiI), while 2D MSCs in large size caused much larger infarcts in
              all five animals, and substantial amounts of DiI-positive MSCs
              were found in the infarct. Meanwhile, corresponding neurological
              defects were observed in the animals with stroke. In consistence,
              injection of 2D MSCs (average diameter 26.5) caused a marked loss
              of cortical neurons and their axons in Thy1-GFP transgenic mice
              and the activation of microglia in CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice in
              the area with MSC entrapment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest

               homogeneity (or lack of) of the cellular distribution within the
               scaffold of the perfusion bioreactor: a pre-requisite for the
               subsequent successful uniform growth of a viable bone tissue
               engineered construct. Flows inside geometrically complex
               scaffolds have been investigated previously and results shown at
               these pore scales. Here, it is our aim to show accurately that
               through the use of modern high performance computers that the
               bioreactor device scale that encloses a scaffold can affect the
               flows and stresses within the pores throughout the scaffold

               Central to this work is that the boundary conditions are derived
               from micro computed tomography scans of both a device chamber

               homogeneous porous flow models of transport must be applied with

              design strategies have made use of computer modelling techniques

              composites of both HA/TCP:BG and coral:BG constructs, which
              displayed a pH of around 7.8, promoted 20-30-fold less amount of

              increasing volumetric flow rates (VFR); (2) Construct Perfusion

  abstract = "In the past decades, bone tissue engineering developed and
              exploited many typologies of bioreactors, which, besides
              providing proper culture conditions, aimed at integrating those
              bio-physical stimulations that cells experience in vivo, to
              promote osteogenic differentiation. Nevertheless, the highly
              challenging combination and deployment of many stimulation
              systems into a single bioreactor led to the generation of several
              unimodal bioreactors, investigating one or at mostly two of the
              required biophysical stimuli. These systems miss the
              physiological mimicry of bone cells environment, and often
              produced contrasting results, thus making the knowledge of bone
              mechanotransduction fragmented and often inconsistent. To
              overcome this issue, in this study we developed a perfusion and
              electroactive-vibrational reconfigurable stimulation bioreactor
              to investigate the differentiation of SaOS-2 bone-derived cells,
              hosting a piezoelectric nanocomposite membrane as cell culture
              substrate. This multimodal perfusion bioreactor is designed based
              on a numerical (finite element) model aimed at assessing the
              possibility to induce membrane nano-scaled vibrations (with ~12
              nm amplitude at a frequency of 939 kHz) during perfusion
              (featuring 1.46 dyn cm-2 wall shear stress), large enough for
              inducing a physiologically-relevant electric output (in the order
              of 10 mV on average) on the membrane surface. This study explored
              the effects of different stimuli individually, enabling to switch
              on one stimulation at a time, and then to combine them to induce
              a faster bone matrix deposition rate. Biological results
              demonstrate that the multimodal configuration is the most
              effective in inducing SaOS-2 cell differentiation, leading to
              20-fold higher collagen deposition compared to static cultures,
              and to 1.6- and 1.2-fold higher deposition than the perfused- or
              vibrated-only cultures. These promising results can provide

              (bioprinting) and non-biological applications. Due to a high
              degree of freedom for geometrical parameters in 3D printing,
              prototype printing of bioreactors is a promising approach in the
              field of Tissue Engineering. The variety of printers, materials,
              printing parameters and device settings is difficult to overview
              both for beginners as well as for most professionals. In order to
              address this problem, we designed a guidance including test
              bodies to elucidate the real printing performance for a given
              printer system. Therefore, performance parameters such as
              accuracy or mechanical stability of the test bodies are
              systematically analysed. Moreover, post processing steps such as
              sterilisation or cleaning are considered in the test procedure.
              The guidance presented here is also applicable to optimise the
              printer settings for a given printer device. As proof of concept,
              we compared fused filament fabrication, stereolithography and
              selective laser sintering as the three most used printing
              methods. We determined fused filament fabrication printing as the
              most economical solution, while stereolithography is most
              accurate and features the highest surface quality. Finally, we
              tested the applicability of our guidance by identifying a printer
              solution to manufacture a complex bioreactor for a perfused
              tissue construct. Due to its design, the manufacture via
              subtractive mechanical methods would be 21-fold more expensive
              than additive manufacturing and therefore, would result in three
              times the number of parts to be assembled subsequently. Using
              this bioreactor we showed a successful 14-day-culture of a
              biofabricated collagen-based tissue construct containing human
              dermal fibroblasts as the stromal part and a perfusable central
              channel with human microvascular endothelial cells. Our study
              indicates how the full potential of biofabrication can be
              exploited, as most printed tissues exhibit individual shapes and
              require storage under physiological conditions, after the

              ensuring adequate nutrient supply, maintaining the desired cell
              distribution and achieving sufficiently high cell yield. To put
              laboratory experiments into a theoretical framework, mathematical
              modelling of the physical and biochemical processes involved in
              tissue growth is a useful tool. In this work, we derive and solve
              a model for a cell-seeded porous scaffold placed in a perfusion
              bioreactor in which fluid delivers nutrients to the cells. The
              model describes the key features, including fluid flow, nutrient
              delivery, cell proliferation and consequent variation of scaffold
              porosity. Fluid flow through the porous scaffold is modelled by
              Darcy's law, and nutrient delivery is described by a
              reaction-advection-diffusion equation. A reaction-diffusion
              equation describes the evolution of cell density, in which cell
              proliferation is modelled via logistic growth and cell spreading

              effect of shear stress on nutrient consumption and cell
              proliferation is also included in the model. COMSOL (a commercial
              finite element solver) is used to solve the model numerically.

              bone has been widely studied in bone tissue engineering by
              perfusion cultures. Nevertheless, there is still debate regarding
              the in-vitro mechanical stimulation regime. This study aims at
              investigating the effect of two different flow rates (vlow =
              0.001m/s and vhigh = 0.061m/s) on the growth of mineralized
              tissue produced by human mesenchymal stromal cells cultured on
              3-D silk fibroin scaffolds. The flow rates applied were chosen to
              mimic the mechanical environment during early fracture healing or
              during bone remodeling, respectively. Scaffolds cultured under
              static conditions served as a control. Time-lapsed micro-computed
              tomography showed that mineralized extracellular matrix formation
              was completely inhibited at vlow compared to vhigh and the static
              group. Biochemical assays and histology confirmed these results
              and showed enhanced osteogenic differentiation at vhigh whereas
              the amount of DNA was increased at vlow. The biological response
              at vlow might correspond to the early stage of fracture healing,
              where cell proliferation and matrix production is prominent.
              Visual mapping of shear stresses, simulated by computational
              fluid dynamics, to 3-D micro-computed tomography data revealed
              that shear stresses up to 0.39mPa induced a higher DNA amount and
              shear stresses between 0.55mPa and 24mPa induced osteogenic
              differentiation. This study demonstrates the feasibility to drive
              cell behavior of human mesenchymal stromal cells by the flow
              velocity applied in agreement with mechanical loading mimicking
              early fracture healing (vlow) or bone remodeling (vhigh). These
              results can be used in the future to tightly control the behavior
              of human mesenchymal stromal cells towards proliferation or
              differentiation. Additionally, the combination of experiment and
              simulation presented is a strong tool to link biological

              cultured with or without osteogenic differentiation medium were
              exposed to fluid flow-induced shear stress and analyzed for
              alkaline phosphatase activity and expression of osteogenic genes.
              RESULTS: Immediately following shear stress, alkaline phosphatase
              activity in osteogenic medium was significantly increased. At
              days 4 and 8 of culture the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic
              protein-2 and osteopontin was significantly higher in hMSCs
              subjected to shear stress than those cultured in static

              (~100, ~200, and ~300 $\mu$m). The HCSs were composed of AB-type
              carbonate apatite with ~8.5\% carbonate ions, i.e., the same
              composition as human bone mineral. Their honeycomb architecture
              displayed uniformly sized and orderly arranged channels with
              extremely high interconnectivity, and all the HCSs displayed
              ~100-$\mu$m-thick struts and 0.06 cm3 g-1 of micropore volume.
              The compressive strengths of HCSs with ~100-, ~200-, and
              ~300-$\mu$m channels were higher than those of reported
              scaffolds, and decreased with increasing channel size: 62 $\pm$
              6, 55 $\pm$ 9, and 43 $\pm$ 8 MPa, respectively. At four weeks
              after implantation in rabbit femur bone defects, new bone and
              blood vessels were formed in all the channels of these HCSs.
              Notably, the ~300-$\mu$m channels were extensively occupied by
              new bone. We demonstrated that high interconnectivity and
              uniformity of channels can decrease the threshold of effective
              macropore size, enabling the scaffolds to maintain high
              mechanical properties and osteogenic ability and serve as
              implants for weight-bearing areas.",

  abstract = "Introduction Cases of intractable dental implant require vertical
              bone augmentation; however, the predicted bone height and volume
              are difficult to obtain. In vertical bone augmentation, the
              contact surface between the scaffold and the bone is limited to
              the bottom face of the scaffold. Furthermore, the strength
              decrease caused by scaffold resorption leads to collapse of the
              augmented site, leading to a decrease in the bone volume and
              height. Objectives To promote bone ingrowth, we fabricated
              carbonate apatite (i.e., bone mineral) honeycomb (HC) scaffolds
              with uniaxial channels vertically penetrating the scaffold.
              Furthermore, we controlled the scaffold resorption rate,
              eventually the endurability for compression, and the bone height
              and volume by controlling the strut thickness. Methods The
              channel aperture was controlled to be 230--260 $\mu$m to promote
              bone ingrowth. Furthermore, the strut thicknesses of the HC
              scaffolds were adjusted to 100, 200, and 300 $\mu$m to control
              the scaffold resorption; these scaffolds were designated as
              HC100, HC200, and HC300, respectively. Results At 4 weeks
              post-implantation on rabbit calvarium, all scaffolds had already
              vertically augmented new bone close to the top surface of the
              scaffold. In the following 8 weeks, the height and amount of new
              bone in all scaffolds increased. Notably, HC300 was resorbed
              synchronously with new bone formation, allowing it to endure the
              compression from the fasciae for 12 weeks post-implantation.
              Furthermore, HC300 formed larger-diameter blood vessels than
              those of HC100 and HC200. Conclusion The HC scaffolds surpassed
              the various combined scaffolds and growth factors or stem cells
              in the ability for vertical bone augmentation. Thus, the HC
              structure is inherently suitable for vertical bone augmentation.
              Notably, the HC scaffolds with 300-$\mu$m-thick struts enhanced
              both new bone formation and angiogenesis. This study revealed a
              structurally suitable design for achieving an outstanding outcome

              scaffolds that promote rapid bone ingrowth and subsequent bone

              as well as influence of different locations of the cells lodged
              on the scaffold on effective mechanical stimulations of the stem
              cells are of the main goals of this study. For this purpose,
              collagen-based scaffolds and implicit surfaces of the pore

              that fluid-induced wall shear stress (WSS) can stimulate cells to
              produce mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM). The application
              of WSS on seeded cells can be achieved through bioreactors that
              perfuse medium through porous scaffolds. In BTE experiments in
              vitro, commonly a constant flow rate is used. Previous studies
              have found that tissue growth within the scaffold will result in
              an increase of the WSS over time. To keep the WSS in a reported
              optimal range of 10-30 mPa, the applied external flow rate can be
              decreased over time. To investigate what reduction of the
              external flow rate during culturing is needed to keep the WSS in
              the optimal range, we here conducted a computational study, which
              simulated the formation of ECM, and in which we investigated the
              effect of constant fluid flow and different fluid flow reduction
              scenarios on the WSS. It was found that for both constant and
              reduced fluid flow scenarios, the WSS did not exceed a critical
              value, which was set to 60 mPa. However, the constant flow
              velocity resulted in a reduction of the cell/ECM surface being
              exposed to a WSS in the optimal range from 50\% at the start of
              culture to 18.6\% at day 21. Reducing the fluid flow over time
              could avoid much of this effect, leaving the WSS in the optimal
              range for 40.9\% of the surface at 21 days. Therefore, for
              achieving more mineralized tissue, the conventional manner of
              loading the perfusion bioreactors (i.e. constant flow
              rate/velocity) should be changed to a decreasing flow over time
              in BTE experiments. This study provides an in silico tool for

               Bioreactors are used to provide a tissue-specific physiological
               in vitro environment during tissue maturation. Based on the
               bioreactor technology, various tissue systems can be incubated
               in vitro. In this chapter, there is a thorough review of the
               different types of bioreactor applications that are used during
               the tissue-engineering process. It demonstrates the basic
               principles and requirements for bioreactor development. The use
               of bioreactor systems for the expansion of clinically relevant
               tissue types is addressed. Specifically, bioreactors for
               connective tissue engineering are discussed. The possibility of
               generating tissue systems that can incubate and provide degrees

               Computational analysis of a perfusion bioreactor has been
               carried out to understand mechanical stimuli and environment.
               During maturation processes in vivo mechanical factors are vital
               for the establishment of the tissue functions. These factors
               include hydrostatic pressure and shear stress, which are
               critical toward understanding the tissue formation. To
               understand the mechanical stimuli properties on cartilaginous
               tissues, a novel perfusion bioreactor was fabricated. This
               bioreactor was designed to hold a scaffold and through the use
               of fluid flow. Here mechanical stimulus is applied to the tissue
               structure with a continuous supply of fresh oxygenated media and
               removal of waste products that are produced by continuous
               cellular metabolic activity. By using computation fluid

              microbioreactor system, which enables the cultivation of 3D cell
              cultures in an oxygen-controlled environment in up to four
              independent-operating bioreactors. Therefore, perfusion
              microbioreactors were designed with the help of computer-aided
              design, and manufactured using the 3D printing technologies
              stereolithography and fused deposition modeling. A uniform flow
              distribution in the microbioreactor was shown using a
              computational fluid dynamics model. For oxygen measurements,
              microsensors were integrated in the bioreactors to measure the
              oxygen concentration (OC) in the geometric center of the 3D cell
              cultures. To control the OC in each bioreactor independently, an
              automated feedback loop was developed, which adjusts the
              perfusion velocity according to the oxygen sensor signal.
              Furthermore, an automated cell seeding protocol was implemented
              to facilitate the even distribution of cells within a stable
              scaffold in a reproducible way. As proof of concept, the human
              mesenchymal stem cell line SCP-1 was seeded on bovine cancellous
              bone matrix of 1 cm3 and cultivated in the developed
              microbioreactor system at different oxygen levels. The oxygen
              control was capable to maintain preset oxygen levels $\pm$0.5\%
              over a cultivation period of several days. Using the automated
              cell seeding procedure resulted in evenly distributed cells
              within a stable scaffold. In summary, the developed
              microbioreactor system enables the cultivation of 3D cell
              cultures in an automated and thus reproducible way by providing
              up to four independently operating, oxygen-controlled

The biological complexity of in vivo conditions encouraged many researchers to evaluate the role of ES via in vitro devices1. Among the several ES delivery methods, direct coupling is the one that fairly mimics implantable devices.
The electrochemical properties of in vitro ES devices and the characteristics of the delivered electrical field remain broadly understudied. Electrode materials have a critical role in determining the impedance (Z) and charge injection capacity (CIC) of the system. A small CIC and high Z require larger potentials to inject a significant amount of charge, which may corrode the electrode or hydrolyse the electrolyte. In addition, electrochemical reactions result in by-products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) or changes in the pH, which are harmful for the cells2. Nano-structuration is shown to improve the electrochemical properties of bioelectrodes.
In this study, we defined biologically safe limits of ES delivered by both Pt thin films (TF) and nanostructured (NC) electrodes incorporated in an in vitro ES device. To this end, we performed comprehensive electrochemi-cal characterization in biologically relevant conditions.},

              away from unfavorable fields and forces in the vicinity of the
              electrodes. ECSARA was tested for its temporal stability,

              24 h, the viability (population) of EF-stimulated cells was
              smaller than non-stimulated control (0.8) but after 72 h they
              outnumbered the control (1.2) indicating that stimulation

              paper tries to provide a review of the applications of 3D
              printing in bone tissue engineering. METHODS: Searching by
              keywords, from the Scopus database, to identify relevant latest
              research articles on 3D printing in bone tissue engineering,
              through ``3D printing'' ``bone tissue engineering''. This study
              makes a bibliometric analysis of the identified research articles
              and identified major applications and steps. RESULTS: 3D printing
              technology creates innovative development in bone tissue
              engineering. It involves the manufacturing of a scaffold with the
              combination of cells and materials. We identified a total number

              searching through keywords ``3D printing'' ``bone tissue
              engineering''. This paper studies 3D printing technology and its
              significant contributions, benefits and steps used for bone

              bone tissue engineering and identifies its five significant
              advancements when 3D printing is used. Finally, ten useful
              applications of 3D printing in bone tissue engineering are
              identified and studied with a brief description. CONCLUSION: In
              orthopaedics, bone defects create a high impact on the quality of
              life of the patient. It leads to a higher demand for bone
              substitutes for replacement of bone defect. Bone tissue
              engineering can help to replace a critical defect bone. 3D
              printing is a useful technology for the fabrication of scaffolds
              critical in bone tissue engineering. There are different binders
              which can create bone scaffolds with requisite mechanical
              strength. These binders are used to create excellent
              osteoconductive, bioactive scaffolds. Computed tomography (CT)
              and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help to provide images of
              specific defects of an individual patient, and these images can
              further be used for 3D printing the detective object. A bone
              defect caused by specific disease is sorted out by
              transplantation in clinical practice. Now a day bone tissue
              engineering opens a new option for this treatment of bone defects

              cell-based therapeutic option for regenerative medicine
              applications as these cells can promote tissue and organ repair.
              In particular, MSC have been applied for the treatment of bone
              fractures. However, the healing capacity of these fractures is
              often compromised by patient's age. Therefore, considering the
              use of autologous MSC, we evaluated the impact of donor age on
              the osteogenic potential of bone marrow (BM)-derived MSC. MSC
              from older patients (60 and 80 years old) demonstrated impaired
              proliferative and osteogenic capacities compared to MSC isolated
              from younger patients (30 and 45 years old), suggesting that
              aging potentially changes the quantity and quality of MSC.
              Moreover, in this study, we investigated the capacity of the
              microenvironment [i.e., extracellular matrix (ECM)] to rescue the
              impaired proliferative and osteogenic potential of aged MSC. In
              this context, we aimed to understand if BM MSC features could be
              modulated by exposure to an ECM derived from cells obtained from
              young or old donors. When aged MSC were cultured on
              decellularized ECM derived from young MSC, their in vitro
              proliferative and osteogenic capacities were enhanced, which did
              not happen when cultured on old ECM. Our results suggest that the
              microenvironment, specifically the ECM, plays a crucial role in
              the quality (assessed in terms of osteogenic differentiation
              capacity) and quantity of MSC. Specifically, the aging of ECM is
              determinant of osteogenic differentiation of MSC. In fact, old
              MSC maintained on a young ECM produced higher amounts of
              extracellularly deposited calcium (9.10 $\pm$ 0.22 vs. 4.69 $\pm$
              1.41 $\mu$g.$\mu$l-1.10-7 cells for young ECM and old ECM,
              respectively) and up-regulated the expression of osteogenic gene
              markers such as Runx2 and OPN. Cell rejuvenation by exposure to a
              functional ECM might be a valuable clinical strategy to overcome
              the age-related decline in the osteogenic potential of MSC by
              recapitulating a younger microenvironment, attenuating the
              effects of aging on the stem cell niche. Overall, this study
              provides new insights on the osteogenic potential of MSC during
              aging and opens new possibilities for developing clinical
              strategies for elderly patients with limited bone formation

              areas of greatest stress. From a clinical perspective, this
              ``law'' is supported by the strong association between bone
              density and physical activity. From a mechanistic standpoint,
              however, the law presents a challenge to scientists seeking to
              understand how osteocytes and osteoblasts sense the mechanical
              load. In the 1960s, collagen piezoelectricity was invoked as a
              potential mechanism by which osteocytes could detect areas of
              greater stress but piezoelectricity diminished in importance as
              more compelling mechanisms, such as streaming potential, were
              identified. In addition, accumulating evidence for the role of
              fluid-related shear stress in osteocyte's mechanosensory function
              has made piezoelectricity seemingly more obsolete in bone
              physiology. This review critically evaluates the role of collagen

              evidence regarding its involvement in strain-generated
              potentials, existing alternate mechanisms, the present

              this newly proposed mechanism. In addition to reviewing the

              poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate)/poly(butylene terephthalate)
              (PEGT/PBT) foam scaffold, was developed to assess the influence
              of the scaffold micro-architecture on local shear stress and
              oxygen levels within the scaffold pores. Experiments were
              performed to derive specific oxygen consumption rates for
              constructs perfused under flow rates of 0.3 and 0.03 ml min(-1).
              While macro-scale and micro-scale models predicted similar
              average oxygen levels at different depths within the scaffold,
              microCT models revealed small local oxygen variations within the
              scaffold micro-architecture. The combined macro-scale/micro-scale
              approach indicated that 0.3 ml min(-1), which subjected 95perc of
              the cells to less than 6.3 mPa shear, would maintain the oxygen
              supply throughout the scaffold above anoxic levels (>1perc), with
              99.5perc of the scaffold supplied with 8-2perc O(2). Alternatively,

              increasing complexity of simulation experiments, there is a high
              demand for better support for them to be conducted. Recently,
              model-driven approaches have been explored for facilitating the
              specification, execution, and reproducibility of simulation
              experiments. However, a more general approach that is suited for
              a variety of modeling and simulation areas, experiment types, and
              tools, which also allows for further automation, is still
              missing. Therefore, we present a novel model-driven engineering
              (MDE) framework for simulation studies that extends the
              state-of-the-art of conducting simulation experiments in the
              following ways: (a) Providing a structured representation of the
              various ingredients of simulation experiments in the form of meta
              models and collecting them in a repository improves knowledge
              sharing across application domains and simulation approaches. (b)
              Specifying simulation experiments in the quasi-standardized form
              of the meta models (e.g., via a GUI) and, subsequently,
              performing the automatic generation of experiment specifications
              in a language of choice increases both the productivity and
              quality of complex simulation experiments. (c) Automatic code
              transformation between specification languages via the meta
              models enables the reusability of simulation experiments. (d)
              Integrating the framework using a command-line interface allows
              for further automation of subprocesses within a simulation study.
              We demonstrate the advantages and practicality of our approach
              using real simulation studies from three different fields of
              simulation (stochastic discrete-event simulation of a cell
              signaling pathway, virtual prototyping of a neurostimulator, and
              finite element analysis of electric fields) and various
              experiment types (global sensitivity analysis, time course
              analysis, and convergence testing). The proposed framework can be
              the starting point for further automation of simulation
              experiments and, therefore, can assist in conducting simulation
              studies in a more systematic and effective manner. For example,
              based on this MDE framework, approaches for automatically
              selecting and parametrizing experimentation methods, or for
              planning follow-up activities depending on the context of the

              and pathological phenomena, being exploited in biomedical
              engineering as well. In this respect, we here present a hybrid
              non-local integro-differential model where a representative cell,
              reproduced by a point particle with an orientation, moves on a
              planar domain upon signals coming from environmental variables.
              From a numerical point of view, non-locality implies the need to
              evaluate integral terms which may present non-regular integrand
              functions because of heterogeneities in the environmental
              conditions and/or in cell sensing region. Having in mind
              multicellular applications, we here propose a robust
              computational method able to handle such non-regularities. The
              procedure is based on low order Runge--Kutta methods and on an ad
              hoc application of the Gauss--Legendre quadrature rule. The
              accuracy and efficiency of the resulting computational method is
              then tested by selected benchmark settings. In this context, the
              ad hoc application of the quadrature rule reveals to be crucial
              to obtain a high accuracy with a remarkably low number of
              quadrature nodes with respect to the standard Gauss--Legendre
              quadrature formula, and which thus results in a reduced overall
              computational cost. Finally, the proposed method is further
              coupled with the cubic spline interpolation scheme which allows
              to deal also with possible poor (i.e., point-wise defined)
              molecular spatial information. The performed simulations (which
              accounts also for different scenarios) show how the interpolation
              of the molecular variables affects the efficiency of the overall
              method and further justify the proposed procedure.",

              primary mediator of mechanical stimuli to bone cells in vivo. In
              vitro investigations have shown that bone cells produce important
              biochemical signals in response to fluid flow applied using
              parallel-plate flow chamber (PPFC) systems. However, the exact
              mechanical stimulus experienced by the cells within these systems

              most challenging multi-physics problem involving the interaction
              between deformable cellular structures and adjacent fluid flows.
              In this study, we use a fluid-structure interaction computational
              approach to investigate the nature of the mechanical stimulus
              being applied to a single osteoblast cell under fluid flow within
              a PPFC system. The analysis decouples the contribution of
              pressure and shear stress on cellular deformation and for the
              first time highlights that cell strain under flow is dominated by
              the pressure in the PPFC system rather than the applied shear
              stress. Furthermore, it was found that strains imparted on the
              cell membrane were relatively low whereas significant strain
              amplification occurred at the cell-substrate interface. These
              results suggest that strain transfer through focal attachments at
              the base of the cell are the primary mediators of mechanical
              signals to the cell under flow in a PPFC system. Such information

              processes of individual stem cells is a problem mostly
              unaddressed. The mathematical approaches to study stem cell
              dynamics have focused on the stem cell population as a whole,
              without resolving individual cells and intracellular processes.
              In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to describe the
              dynamics of a population of stem cells, taking into account the
              processes of the individual cells. We study the influence of the
              applied electric field on the cellular processes. We test our
              mean-field theory with the experiments from the literature,
              involving in vitro electrical stimulation of stem cells. We show
              that a simple model can quantitatively describe the

              of cells and the total alkaline phosphate activity in a

              electrical field, confirming published experimental findings.
              Moreover, our analysis supports the cell density-dependent
              proliferation rate. Since the experimental results are averaged

              pathways to multiply and differentiate into specific cell
              lineages; with undifferentiated hMSCs showing reliance on
              glycolysis. hMSCs differentiating towards an osteogenic phenotype
              rely on oxidative phosphorylation as an energy source. Here, the
              metabolic profile of hMSCs was profiled during osteogenic
              differentiation over 14 days using a non-invasive live-cell
              imaging platform- two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging
              microscopy (2P-FLIM) which images and measures NADH fluorescence.
              During osteogenesis, we observe a higher dependence on oxidative
              phosphorylation for cellular energy; concomitant with an
              increased reliance on anabolic pathways. We validated this
              metabolic profile using qPCR and extracellular metabolite
              analysis and observed a higher reliance on glutaminolysis in the
              earlier time-points of osteogenic differentiation. Based on the
              results obtained, we sought to promote glutaminolysis further
              during osteogenic differentiation. An indirect method of
              promoting glutaminolysis was explored so as to not impact
              cellular differentiation. As Lactate has been shown to promote
              glutamine uptake via c-Myc activation triggering expression of
              glutamine transmembrane transporters and glutaminase 1; we chose
              to increase extracellular lactate concentrations to drive
              increased glutaminolysis rates leading to higher levels of
              mineral deposition and osteogenic gene expression. Lactate
              supplementation of osteogenic medium also promoted upregulation
              of lactate metabolism and increased the expression of
              transmembrane cellular lactate transporters. Higher rates of
              lactate dehydrogenase gene expression coupled with higher NADH
              fluorescence intensity demonstrate a conversion of lactate to
              pyruvate. During this conversion, NADH is formed by the reverse
              enzymatic reaction of lactate dehydrogenase resulting in
              increased NADH fluorescence intensity. In order to evaluate the
              importance of glutaminolysis and lactate metabolism in osteogenic
              differentiation, these metabolic pathways were shut down using
              BPTES and $\alpha$-CHC respectively which led to reduced hMSC
              mineralisation. In summary, we demonstrate that hMSCs osteogenic
              differentiation has a temporal metabolic profile and shift that
              is observed as early as day 3 of cell culture. Osteogenic
              differentiation was demonstrated to be directly dependent on
              OxPhos and on glutaminolysis and validated using biochemical
              assays. Furthermore, extracellular lactate is an essential
              metabolite to ensure osteogenic differentiation as a metabolic
              fuel and signalling molecule to promote glutaminolysis. These
              findings have significant impact in generating potent approaches
              towards bone tissue engineering in vitro and in vivo by engaging
              directly with metabolite driven osteogenesis. \#\#\# Competing

              functionalization leveraging conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
              To this end, CNTs were first sonicated with water-soluble
              single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) to generate a
              negatively charged ssDNA@CNT nano-complex. Concomitantly,
              3D-printed poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) scaffolds were
              ammonolyzed to introduce free amine groups, which can take on a
              positive surface charge in water. The ssDNA@CNT nano-complex was
              then applied to 3D-printed scaffolds through a simple one-step
              coating utilizing electric-static force. This fast and facile

              acts in a feed-forward loop to increase $\beta$-cell

              skeletal muscle and adipose tissue respond to osteocalcin by

              mitosis, neuronal transmission, contraction and relaxation of
              muscles, gene transcription, and cell death. At rest, the
              cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i is approximately 100 nM,
              but this level rises to 500-1,000 nM upon activation. In
              osteoblasts, the elevation of [Ca2+]i is a result of an increase
              in the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum and/or
              extracellular Ca2+ influx through voltage gated Ca2+ channels.
              Many of the cellular effects of Ca2+ are mediated by the Ca2+
              binding protein, calmodulin (CaM). Upon binding up to four
              calcium ions, CaM undergoes a conformational change, which
              enables it to bind to specific proteins eliciting a specific
              response. Calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is a major target of the
              Ca(2+)/CaM second messenger system. Once bound to Ca(2+)/CaM, the
              multimeric CaMKII is released from its autoinhibitory status and
              maximally activated, which then leads to an intraholoenzyme
              autophosphorylation reaction. Calcineurin (Cn) is another major
              target protein that is activated by Ca(2+)/CaM. Cn is a
              serine-threonine phosphatase that consists of a heterodimeric
              protein complex composed of a catalytic subunit (CnA) and a
              regulatory subunit (CnB). Upon activation, Cn directly binds to,
              and dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
              transcription factors within the cytoplasm allowing them to
              translocate to the nucleus and participate in the regulation of
              gene expression. This review will examine the potential

              normal healing. On the same note, pathologically high levels of
              ROS cause a sharp decline in osteogenesis and promote nonunion in

              (the Haversian system) form structural and functional units of

              that the osteon structure (including osteocytes, lamellae,

              of the osteon structure is crucial for cortical bone
              regeneration. This article provides a systematic summary of
              recent advances in osteons, including the structure, function,
              turnover, and regenerative strategies. First, the hierarchical
              structure of osteons is illustrated and the critical functions of

              remodeling processes of osteons at a cellular level and the

              integrins in osteocyte function (cell adhesion, signalling, and
              mechanotransduction) and possible role in disease. RECENT
              FINDINGS: Both $\beta$1 and $\beta$3 integrins subunits have been
              shown to be required for osteocyte mechanotransduction.
              Antagonism of these integrin subunits in osteocytes resulted in
              impaired responses to fluid shear stress. Various disease states
              (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, bone metastases) have been shown

              the calcification sites of the skeletal tissue. It promotes
              hydroxyapatite crystal formation by degrading inorganic
              pyrophosphate (PPi) and increasing inorganic phosphate (Pi)
              concentration. However, abnormalities in Alpl-/- mouse-derived
              osteoblasts are poorly understood, and the involvement of TNAP in
              osteoblast differentiation remains unclear. Therefore, in this
              study, we aimed to investigate the precise role of TNAP in
              osteoblast differentiation. TNAP inhibition by levamisole, a
              reversible TNAP inhibitor, suppressed the expression of
              osteoblast differentiation marker genes in wild-type osteoblastic
              cells. Alpl overexpression increased the expression of master

              pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a popular topic in bone tissue
              engineering. Although many improvements have been achieved, the
              low induction efficiency because of spontaneous differentiation
              hampers their applications. To solve this problem, a detailed
              understanding of the osteogenic differentiation process of hPSCs
              is urgently needed. METHODS: Monolayer cultured human embryonic
              stem cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cells were
              differentiated in commonly applied serum-containing osteogenic
              medium for 35 days. In addition to traditional assays such as
              cell viability detection, reverse transcription-polymerase chain
              reaction, immunofluorescence, and alizarin red staining, we also
              applied studies of cell counting, cell telomerase activity, and
              flow cytometry as essential indicators to analyse the cell type
              changes in each week. RESULTS: The population of differentiated
              cells was quite heterogeneous throughout the 35 days of
              induction. Then, cell telomerase activity and cell cycle analyses
              have value in evaluating the cell type and tumourigenicity of the
              obtained cells. Finally, a dynamic map was made to integrate the
              analysis of these results during osteogenic differentiation of
              hPSCs, and the cell types at defined stages were concluded.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results lay the foundation to improve the in
              vitro osteogenic differentiation efficiency of hPSCs by
              supplementing with functional compounds at the desired stage, and
              then establishing a stepwise induction system in the future.",

              there is some evidence that fluid force improves the osteogenic

              design concept and operational configuration of each study, the
              experimental setups of perfusion bioreactor systems are not

              different systems, the thorough optimization and validation of
              experimental configuration are required in each system. In this
              study, optimal experimental conditions for a perfusion bioreactor
              were explored in three steps. First, an in silico modeling was
              performed using a scaffold geometry obtained by microCT and an
              expedient geometry parameterized with porosity and permeability
              to assess the accuracy of calculated fluid shear stress and

              to 15 mPa was sufficient to induce osteogenesis, but cell growth
              was severely impacted by the volume of perfused medium, the
              presence of air bubbles, and medium evaporation, all of which are
              common concerns in perfusion bioreactor systems. This study

              variables, which may often be underreported or overlooked, and

              demonstrated that the inclusion of LDH to PCL scaffold increased
              mechanical tensile strength from 1.63 $\pm$ 0.4 to 1.920 $\pm$
              0.3 Mpa for the pure PCL and PCL + LDH (1 wt\%) scaffolds,
              respectively. A decrease in the average diameter of PCL
              nanofibers was observed with the addition of LDH. The enrichment
              of PCL scaffold with LDH promotes in vitro biomineralization when
              subjected to simulated body fluid (SBF), indicating the bioactive
              features of the nanocomposite scaffolds. In addition, increased
              of LDH leads to improvement in protein adsorption capacity
              compared to the pure one. Furthermore, the cytocompatibility and
              cytotoxicity of nanocomposite fibers was assessed using human
              MG-63 osteoblast-like cells. The LDH/PCL scaffold induced mineral
              deposition and osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 as evident by
              an increase in ALP activity in comparison with the pure PCL.
              Overall, our results revealed that electrospun PCL-LDH nanofiber
              might be an ideal choice for bone tissue engineering.",

              was identified in vivo using intramedullary pressure (ImP) and
              streaming potential (SP) measurements, and allowed the
              development of a load-induced flow mechanism which considers
              mechanotransduction and mechanoelectrotransduction phenomena. An
              avian model was used for monitoring, simultaneously, ImP and SP
              under axial loading which generated peak strains of approximately
              600 microstrain (microepsilon). ImP response to step-load decayed
              more quickly than SP relaxation, in which multiple time constants
              were observed during the relaxations. While the initial
              relaxation of SP showed a decay on the order of 200 ms, ImP
              decayed on the order of approximately 100 ms. After the initial
              decay (approximately 200 ms after loading), ImP quickly relaxed
              to base line, while SP continued to dominate relaxation. It
              appears that the decay of ImP is indicative of resistive fluid
              flow occurring primarily in the vasculature and other
              intraosseous channels such as lacunar-canalicular pores, and that
              SP represents the fluid flow in the smaller porosities, i.e.,
              lacunar-canalicular system or even microspores. These results
              suggest that SP and ImP decays are determined by a hierarchical
              interdependent system of multiple porosities, and that the
              temporal dynamics of load-bearing define the manner in which the
              fluid patterns and pressures are distributed.",
